# Multimodal simultaneous NMT

This repository is a stripped down clone of the upstream `nmtpytorch` repository.

## Contributors

- Veneta Haralampieva added parts related to Transformers
- Julia Ive added all parts relating to reinforcement learning (RL) based
simultaneous MT and MMT.

## Installation

The installation should be straightforward using anaconda. The below command will install the toolkit in `develop` mode into a newly created `simnmt` environment. This will allow your changes to the GIT checkout folder to be instantaneously reflected to the imported modules and executable scripts.

```
conda env create -f environment.yml
```
